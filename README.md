# Robotics-Tools
Tools used for the "Introduction to Robotics" Class at Unitn, comprehensive of all formulas and instruction for jointed robotic arms, and maybe more...?

## Structure of the project

For now it will be a ''main.cpp'' file containing the description of the robot that will need to be define pre-compilation. In a later stage I plan to create a joint-sequencing step so that everything can be done at run-time.

## Available joints

 - Ball joint
 - Slide joint
 - Cilinder joint

## Available functions
